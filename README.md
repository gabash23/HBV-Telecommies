# HBVtelecommies

This is BCAr.fun...but better! 
The webpage contains a simple bicolor design with a dark screen as well as the necessary links to BCA activities.
In addition to 15 links, a chatbox demo is also included, in which a user can submit comments to the chatbox after entering his/her username.

The "rise from the ashes" aspect is included in the very attractive organized design (arranged 4x4) as well as the addition of a chatting system.
